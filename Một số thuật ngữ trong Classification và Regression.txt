Classification and regression glossary<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><i>Sample or input</i>: One data point that goes into your model.</li>
<li><i>Prediction or output:&nbsp;</i>What comes out of your model.</li>
<li><i>Target</i>: The truth. What your model should ideally have predicted, according to an external source of data.</li>
<li><i>Prediction error or loss value</i>: A measure of the distance between your model’s prediction and the target.</li>
<li><i>Classes</i>: A set of possible labels to choose from in a classification problem. For example, when classifying cat and dog pictures, “dog” and “cat” are the two classes.</li>
<li><i>Label</i>: A specific instance of a class annotation in a classification problem. For instance, if picture #1234 is annotated as containing the class “dog,” then “dog” is a label of picture #1234.</li>
<li><i>Ground-truth or annotations</i>: All targets for a dataset, typically collected by humans.</li>
<li>Binary classification: A classification task where each input sample should be categorized into two exclusive categories.</li>
<li><i>Multiclass classification</i>: A classification task where each input sample should be categorized into more than two categories: for instance, classifying handwritten digits.</li>
<li><i>Multilabel classification</i>: A classification task where each input sample can be assigned multiple labels. For instance, a given image may contain both a cat and a dog and should be annotated both with the “cat” label and the “dog” label. The number of labels per image is usually variable.</li>
<li><i>Scalar regression</i>: A task where the target is a continuous scalar value. Predicting house prices is a good example: the different target prices form a continuous space.</li>
<li><i>Vector regression</i>: A task where the target is a set of continuous values: for example, a continuous vector. If you’re doing regression against multiple values (such as the coordinates of a bounding box in an image), then you’re doing vector regression.</li>
<li><i>Mini-batch or batch</i>: A small set of samples (typically between 8 and 128) that are processed simultaneously by the model. The number of samples is often a power of 2, to facilitate memory allocation on GPU. When training, a mini-batch is used to compute a single gradient-descent update applied to the weights of the model.</li>
